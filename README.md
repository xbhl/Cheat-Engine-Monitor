# This is a learning project
This project is heavily inspired by CheatBuddy's sysguard. I found it cool how he was able to monitor the presence of Cheat Engine so I decided to try it myself.

I don't plan on releasing this as a finalized project, but rather as an project to help me learn about Window's API.
Through being able to filter Window names (FINISHED) for the program to be able to detect Cheat Engine being open through different medias such as the "Speed hack" module or scan button's presence

Next step: Debating whether to implement multiple CE versions for the window title or to implement the speed hack module presence for universal support.
